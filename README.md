Android socket.io file uploader sample code
===============================

This is test project I used in http://www.androidwebterminal.com/ to upload a file to NodeJS server via Android device. I thought of putting it in the github so it may help someone else.

Android project requires reference to AndroidAsync project @ https://github.com/koush/AndroidAsync
